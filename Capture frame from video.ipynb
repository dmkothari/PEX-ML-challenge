I chose to download the YouTube video as the internet connection was quite unreliable at my place (spartans were less on amenities, eh! =D ), so I rather worked with offline data stored in my system. I downloaded the YouTube video using a freeware available online. <br>\n",

    "We use OpenCV(cv2) to capture frame from a video. We have the freedom to choose and save which frames we want, because it can go through each and every frame. Considering that YouTube video(s) are well crafted, dont have too many jumpcuts and are generally decodable  when you freeze a frame (i.e. not all frames are blurry when you freeze them). Also keeping in mind that the video(s) are consistent and within 3-5 seconds time window in a video we have the same image/information. <br>\n",

Then we have one frame every 5 seconds, as previously when I captured one frame per second, the data set had a lot of redundent images. <br>\n",
